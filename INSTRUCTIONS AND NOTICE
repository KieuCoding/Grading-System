HOW TO OPERATE
1.) Run C++ file on compiler
2.) Enter an id number for the student ex: (id: 123456)
3.) Enter in 4 test grades for the student
4.) Do this for the next couple of students

RESULTS: You'll see all the students letter grades and the whole student body's average for each test
PURPOSE: Gain a basic understanding on how User Interface (UI) work via this simple example
NOTE: You can playaround and modify this code to learn more or improve my code's U.I
